I offer freelance consultancy services within the field of software development. 

## Software development projects

I love to code. C# / .NET - and mostly backend services. I can deliver projects on my own or I can often gather a small team of experienced freelance developers. Specification, planning, estimates, coding, testing, deployment, documentation. Everything dosed at the right amount according the requirements of your project.

## Interim management

Has life taken a turn for one of your managers? I can step in and manage a software development team. Sprint planning, daily stand-ups, pull-requests, technology choices, architecture discussions, people management, upper management reporting, product management coordination.

## Establish a remote development team

I have good connections in Bulgaria and can help establish remote development teams through proven recruiters and my own assessment of developer skills and personality.

## Teaching

I am currently preparing standard courses in topics I find interesting. One could be "Hands-on microservices architecture". Another could be "Why not give F# a try?"
