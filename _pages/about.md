## Essentials

I would have been a captain, if my career had not taken me to where I am now. I like responsibility, I like to be in charge, I like the freedom to steer, I like being alert of changes and risks, I like to make everyone on board do their best, I like to struggle and put in whatever it takes, and I like to safely reach the goal of the journey.
I naturally take leadership, and I enjoy working with skilled and challenging people. I have always worked within the IT industry and in such settings; my technology, people and business experience always come to play.
I am curious by nature and I like to take up new challenges. I value honesty, I like to develop and improve, I like to deliver quality and I like to work with stakeholders at all organizational levels.

## Professional

With a Master Degree in Computer Science from Københavns Universitet ([DIKU](https://di.ku.dk/)) I got a proper education to become a programmer. Hence,
I have coded a lot in my life, but not nearly as much as I want to. I have pretty much always worked with software developers and for many years I have been managing various teams of such. As a manager I find the most effective way to minimize management is by being a programmer on the team myself. I think the best manager is the one that realizes, that the less management work done the better, as long as the team members are thriving and quality code is being developed at an efficient pace.
And then you get to code as much as possible, which is great when you love to code! 

Do you know [Advent of Code?](https://adventofcode.com/) If not sign up for a fun Christmas Event! Challeging programming puzzels, that get harder and harder as you get closer to the 24th of December. Good to do some spare time coding besides professional coding. I used F# during the last round and enjoyed it tremendously.

## Private

My dad bought an old wood [OK-jolle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK_(dinghy)) when I was around 10. That founded my love of sailing. We sailed on a small lake in Jutland and after some years we upgraded to a [Pirat-jolle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_(dinghy)). One of my best friends got a [Flipper-jolle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipper_(dinghy)) which was super fun to sail with trapeze and a small spinaker. One summer we rented a Delanta yacht and then my dad after building our own house started building a wooden sail yacht of brand Boheme 870. Don't ever do that... Fast forward through windsurfing, [606](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monark_606), [Yngling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yngling_(keelboat)), [Maxi 77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxi_77), [Laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_(dinghy)), Phantom 42 (the sailing yacht) and now I am at the pinacle of my sailing career with the most wonderful boat ever designed and beautifully crafted - the [Swan 46](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_46_Mk_I).

Is sailing all I do privately? No no no, but it sure does take quite some of my attention and luckily my daughters too.
