### The "me" version

Many organizations use Office 365 and Microsoft Teams as their collaboration platform or Google Workspace and Google Chat. These are great tools for collaboration and communication, but they are not really designed for e.g. project management or handling of customer support tickets, sales leads, recruitment processes, etc.

You can get a long way with Excel in a shared drive and a shared mailbox, but at some point you may start thinking we need a better solution as your business grows. You start looking for specific solutions that are easy to use, that can be customized to your specific needs and that can be integrated with your other systems.

You can find lots of solutions that can do one job quite well, but they are often quite expensive and they are not easy to customize or integrate with your other systems.

monday.com is a rather generic solution - a kind of LEGO box of software building blocks - that makes it easy for you to quickly build your own solution, that does the job and makes it easy to customize when your needs change in the future as they inevitably will.

It will probably never be quite as good as a solution that is designed specifically to solve one problem, but it will be much cheaper and much easier to adapt to your changing needs. And in many cases simplicity and ease of use is more important than a perfect (temporary) fit.

Another great benefit is that you can simply try it out with a few users and if you don't like it, you can just stop using it. No need to call a consultant to get it installed and configured. No need to pay for a license for a year or more. No need to pay for expensive consultants to customize it for you. You can do it yourself. And if you need help, you can get it from monday.com or from a consultant like me.

## no-code customizations

As a user of monday.com you can customize your boards and workflows without any coding. You can create custom views, custom fields, automations, integrations and more. This does not require any coding skills and with a bit of training and instructions you'll be able to do it yourself without calling expensive consultants like me. Unless you need help of course. Or custom integrations. Then you can call me.
