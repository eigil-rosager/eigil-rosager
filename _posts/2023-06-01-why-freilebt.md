I once saw an interview with [Leonard Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Cohen) on my TV. It was when he was turning seventy. The interviewer asked the simple question *"So Leonard, how do you feel now?"*. Leonard paused a bit and then he said *"I feel like I am at the onset of all the diseases that finally kills you"*. The journalist really didn't know what to say as a follow up comment to something that was so blatantly true, but also quite discomforting for most people even though we all know that is how it goes. 

Probably known to most, Leonard continued as an active artist all the way to the end and published his last album three weeks before he died.  

That is also what I intend. Not to become an artist, but continue all the way to the end. Easy promise - I don't have to put in much of an effort to achieve that, so let me add "active". I intend to stay active, especially professionally until my very end. I don't think working until one fine day and then completely stopping is a good exit model for me. Full speed ahead and then nothing... won't work. 

Work and your professional identity is not something you just leave behind and forget all about. At least not for me. How do I know? Well, working with software development has been such a big part and pleasure of my life, that it would be kind of ridiculous not to acknowledge that it is much more than just a job and an income.

When I took one year leave of absence from work to pursue my life long sailing love affair with my three daughters, my partner and friends of ours, I didn't fully understand how difficult it would be to leave my current life behind. But after several months of struggling and total change of plans I settled into a new state of mind in which I got good time to reflect upon past and future times. 

Looking back, I don't really regret anything (thank you for a fluid memory that suppresses the (few I believe) episodes that I clearly could have handled better). Hence a green checkmark on the "past". What about the "future"? I tend to believe we have free will, even though it doesn't really fit with scientific determinism, but it is a well-working assumption that I will stick to. That said, I might have a slight bit of influence on what is coming to me, so how do I then intend to use that influence? 

This is where *freilebt* gets a role. *freilebt* is the name of a consultancy company I created May 31st 2023. I have now stopped working full time as an employee and as always in my life I am already working more than full time again - but now as a freelancer. Hence, I have resumed the role of being the sole boss in my own professional work life again. Just like I did, when I during my years of studying at [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/) and [DIKU](https://di.ku.dk/) had income from freelance developer engagements. And I truly enjoy this. My goal is to have a life in freedom with lots of interesting consultancy engagements within the field of software development and a growing list of IT topics that I teach, shorter and longer sailing trips with friends and family and the ability to work abroad to fight the dark winter months in Denmark for starters. 

*freilebt* is also this blog, starting with this post. 

I intend to write some posts about my views on various political issues. Facebook and Twitter can be used for commenting and discussions, but the format doesn't work well to present one's thoughts in sufficient detail and the debate sections in newspapers have so limited bandwidth that your chances of getting through the filtering mechanisms being a genuine nobody are meek.

I will probably also post reflections about sailing topics. It will not be a personal family photo album - those I keep in my private Facebook group "Til SÃ¸s med Eigil" - rather I will try to write about issues that might interest other sailors and in this context sailors sailing with sails for fun.

There are immense amounts of blogs about software development, that no matter what you Google, you typically will find a rather perfect answer very quickly to exactly the problem you are facing. This is amazing. I intend to write some blog posts about software development issues. Most likely quite unstructured, but hopefully with some insights that other people can use. Maybe a theme could be "Advice to my younger self from an elder me".

I think most posts will be written in English, but probably also an occasional post in Danish if the topic is entirely relevant for danes.

Why mix personal and professional posts? Why even blog anything? Why do I think I have something to offer? Basically I intend to stay active to the end and to do so I need to engage with people around me. I am not super confident in establishing new relations, so marketing people can relax completely - I am no going for their positions - and this goes for telemarketing in particular and general sales jobs too. So what do I do?

Flashing Instagram photos of myself and my surroundings will attract ridicule and could hence be an option! Could I become a YouTuber unboxing the week's vegetables from Aarstiderne every Monday morning? If I, to my great surprise, will reappear as a reborn at some point, I seriously hope most of social media have disappeared. Otherwise I will, if I carry just a bit of my current skillset along be rather doomed. 

Hence, better stick to something closer to home. I have always enjoyed writing, which is maybe also partly why I enjoy programming, so the blog format seems to suit me well. With a bit of luck and persistence I hope it will prove to be a good means for me to establish new relationships in the safe space and comfort of my home behind the protection of my screen.

Leonard Cohen got 12 years extra after the interview. I am 57 and I really hope to get many healthy active years, which I will do my best to fill with professional software development, sailing, debates, family and what not. Fingers crossed...

Make sure to live your life, while you have it. And feel free to reach out to me.
