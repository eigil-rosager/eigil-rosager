# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,

# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible

  I'm an experienced software development manager that loves to code about as much as I love to sail. 
  I plan to keep coding and sailing for the rest of my life, so with a bit of luck I can keep this blog going for a long time.
  Reach out to me if you think I can help with: software development, teaching, advice or a chat about sailing.
